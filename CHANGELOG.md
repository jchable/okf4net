## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial C# implementation of OKF v0.1, ported from this repository's former
  Rust `okf` implementation (byte-exact parity proven before removal):
  - `OKF4net` library — YAML-subset parser/emitter, `OkfDocument`,
    `Frontmatter`, `ConceptId`, `LinkScanner`, `Bundle`, `IndexGenerator`,
    `ChangeLog`, `BundleValidator`.
  - `okf` CLI (`validate`, `info`, `index`, `graph`, `parse`, `fmt`),
    published as a Native AOT single-file binary.
- Test suite (unit, integration, and byte-exact golden CLI comparisons).

### Changed

- Relicensed from Apache-2.0 to LGPL-3.0-or-later; Apache-2.0 attribution for
  upstream ported portions is preserved in `NOTICE` and `LICENSE.Apache-2.0`.
